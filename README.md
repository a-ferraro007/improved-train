# Live MTA Subway Times 

## *IN PROGRESS*

**A Go websocket server built with Gorilla websocket framework. Goal of this project is to create an efficient websocket server that can handle a large number of agnostic clients ( Web app/PWA, IFrame, IOS/Android App, IOS Widgets) while minimizing the number of API calls to the public MTA API**
